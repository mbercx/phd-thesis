  abstract  = {Through density functional theory calculations, we show that the alloy perovskite system BaZr1-xTixS3 (x {\textless} 0.25) is a promising candidate for producing high power conversion efficiency (PCE) solar cells with ultrathin absorber layers. To maximize the minority carrier lifetime, which is important for achieving high PCE, the defect calculations show that BaZr1-xTixS3 films should be synthesized under moderate (i.e., near stoichiometric) growth conditions to minimize the formation of deep-level defects. The perovskite BaZrS3 is also found to exhibit ambipolar self-doping properties, indicating the ability to form homo p-n junctions. However, our theoretical calculations and experimental solid-state reaction efforts indicate that the doped perovskite BaZr1-xTixS3 (x {\textgreater} 0) may not be stable under thermal equilibrium growth conditions. Calculations of decomposition energies suggest that introducing compressive strain may be a plausible approach to stabilize BaZr1-xTixS3 thin films.},

abstract = {We summarize our recent explorations of photophysical mechanisms that may be utilized in solar cells with power conversion efficiency theoretically exceeding the Shockley-Queisser limit. The dominant losses responsible for the Shockley-Queisser limit are below band-gap and thermalization (hot carrier) losses; together, they account for {\textgreater}55{\%} of the total absorbed solar energy. This perspective focuses on two photophysical mechanisms, hot carrier equilibration and carrier multiplication, which may be used to reduce these losses through their utilization in novel solar cell designs. For the implementation of a hot carrier solar cell, we discuss the necessity of hot carrier scattering as well as the photon flux challenge. Although recent experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of hot-electron extraction from photo-excited semiconductor nano-crystals, the photon flux challenge cannot be met in these materials. We propose graphene and related materials as potentially ideal chromophores for hot carrier solar cells. For the multi-exciton solar cell, we focus on the molecular analog called singlet fission. Recent experiments in our lab revealed a quantum coherent mechanism in which photo-excitation of the organic semiconductor pentacene or tetracene creates a quantum superposition of singlet exciton and multi-exciton states. This quantum superposition and the corresponding decoherence time (i.e., singlet fission time) are critical to the competing dynamics of charge or energy harvesting. We discuss design principles for solar cells based on singlet fission materials. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

  abstract      = {Chalcopyrite semiconductors are of considerable interest for application as absorber layers in thin-film photovoltaic cells. When growing films of these compounds, however, they are often found to contain CuAu-like domains, a metastable phase of chalcopyrite. It has been reported that for CuInS2, the presence of the CuAu-like phase improves the short circuit current of the chalcopyrite-based photovoltaic cell. We investigate the thermodynamic stability of both phases for a selected list of I-III-VI2 materials using a first-principles density functional theory approach. For the CuIn-VI2 compounds, the difference in formation energy between the chalcopyrite and CuAu-like phase is found to be close to 2 meV per atom, indicating a high likelihood of the presence of CuAu-like domains. Next, we calculate the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) of the CuAu-like phase and compare the results with those of the corresponding chalcopyrite phase. We identify several candidates with a high efficiency, such as CuAu-like CuInS2, for which we obtain an SLME of 29{\%} at a thickness of 500 nm. We observe that the SLME can have values above the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit, and show that this can occur because the SQ limit assumes the absorptivity to be a step function, thus overestimating the radiative recombination in the detailed balance approach. This means that it is possible to find higher theoretical efficiencies within this framework simply by calculating the J-V characteristic with an absorption spectrum. Finally, we expand our SLME analysis to indirect band gap absorbers by studying silicon, and find that the SLME quickly overestimates the reverse saturation current of indirect band gap materials, drastically lowering their calculated efficiency.},

  abstract = {The principle of superposition is used to derive from fundamentals the widely used shifting approximation that the current-voltage characteristic of an illuminated solar cell is the dark current-voltage characteristic shifted by the short-circuit photocurrent. Thus the derivation requires the linearity of the boundary-value problems that underlie the electrical characteristics. This focus on linearity defines the conditions that must hold if the shifting approximation is to apply with good accuracy. In this regard, if considerable photocurrent and considerable dark thermal recombination current both occur within the junction space-charge region, then the shifting approximation is invalid. From a rigorous standpoint, it is invalid also if lowinjection concentrations of holes and electrons are not maintained throughout the quasi-neutral regions. The presence of sizable series resistance also invalidates the shifting approximation. Methods of analysis are presented to treat these cases for which shifting is not strictly valid. These methods are based on an understanding of the physics of cell operation. This understanding is supported by laboratory experiments and by exact computer solution of the relevant boundary-value problems. For the case of high injection in the base region, the method of analysis employed accurately yields the dependence of the open-circuit voltage on the short-circuit current (or the illumination level).

  abstract = {This paper describes the use, within p-i-n- and n-i-p-type solar cells, of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon ($\mu$c-Si:H) thin films (layers), both deposited at low temperatures (200°C) by plasma-assisted chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), from a mixture of silane and hydrogen. Optical and electrical properties of the i-layers are described. These properties are linked to the microstructure and hence to the i-layer deposition rate, that in turn, affects throughput in production. The importance of contact and reflection layers in achieving low electrical and optical losses is explained, particularly for the superstate case. Especially the required properties for the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) need to be well balanced in order to provide, at the same time, for high electrical conductivity (preferably by high electron mobility), low optical absorption and surface texture (for low optical losses and pronounced light trapping). Single-junction amorphous and microcrystalline p-i-n-type solar cells, as fabricated so far, are compared in their key parameters (Jsc FF, Voc) with the 'theoretical' limiting values. Tandem and multifunction cells are introduced; the $\mu$c-Si: H/a-Si: H or 'micromorph' tandem solar cell concept is explained in detail, and recent results obtained here are listed and commented. Factors governing the mass-production of thin-film silicon modules are determined both by inherent technical reasons, described in detail, and by economic considerations. The cumulative effect of these factors results in distinct efficiency reductions from values of record laboratory cells to statistical averages of production modules. Finally, applications of thin-film silicon PV modules, especially in building-integrated PV (BIPV) are shown. In this context, the energy yields of thin-film silicon modules emerge as a valuable gauge for module performance, and compare very favourably with those of other PV technologies.

In this paper, we present a new simple model (SPCTRAL2) that incorporates improvements to the simple model approach and an algorithm for calculating spectral irradiance on tilted surfaces. The model was developed using comparisons with rigorous radiative transfer codes and limited outdoor measurements. SPCTRAL2 produces terrestrial spectra between 0.3 and 4.0 micrometre with a resolution of approximately 10 nm. Inputs to the model include the solar zenith angle, the collector tilt angle, atmospheric turbidity, the amount of precipitable water vapor and ozone, surface pressure, and ground albedo. A major goal of this work is to provide researchers with the capability to calculate spectral irradiance for different atmospheric conditions and different solar collector geometries using microcomputers.-Authors},

This limit is based on the principle of detailed balance, which equates the photon flux into a device to the particle flux (photons or electrons) out of that device. Nanostructured solar cells represent a novel class of photovoltaic devices, and questions have been raised about whether or not they can exceed the Shockley-Queisser limit. Here we show that single-junction nanostructured solar cells have a theoretical maximum efficiency of {\^{a}} 1/442{\%} under AM 1.5 solar illumination. While this exceeds the efficiency of a non-concentrating planar device, it does not exceed the Shockley-Queisser limit for a planar device with optical concentration. We consider the effect of diffuse illumination and find that with optical concentration from the nanostructures of only×1,000, an efficiency of 35.5{\%} is achievable even with 25{\%} diffuse illumination. We conclude that nanostructured solar cells offer an important route towards higher efficiency photovoltaic devices through a built-in optical concentration.},

abstract = {In this work, the authors compared the properties of multicrystalline silicon solar cells which depended on the kind of following antireflective layers: a-Si:C:H, a-Si:N:H and TiOx. Current-voltage characteristics for multicrystalline silicon solar cells were measured by the use of a computer controlled global spectrum sun simulator under an AM 1.5. The measurements of I-V characteristics allow the determination of basic electrical parameters and efficiency using the double exponential relationship from a two-diode solar cells model. Two key parameters: refractive index and thickness of the film affect the final features of the antireflective coating. Optimisation of these parameters and afterwards the experimental verification lead to the minimalisation of the reflection coefficient that decides about the quality of the antireflective layer. A high quality reflective layer can improve the efficiency of the solar cell even by 30{\%}.},

There has been an enormous infusion of new ideas in the field of solar cells over the last 15 years; discourse on energy transfer has gotten much richer, and nanostructures and nanomaterials have revolutionized the possibilities for new technological developments. However, solar energy cannot become ubiquitous in the world's power markets unless it can become economically competitive with legacy generation methods such as fossil fuels. The new edition of Dr. Stephen Fonash's definitive text points the way toward greater efficiency and cheaper production by adding coverage of cutting-edge topics in plasmonics, multi-exiton generation processes, nanostructures and nanomaterials such as quantum dots. The book's new structure improves readability by shifting many detailed equations to appendices, and balances the first edition's semiconductor coverage with an emphasis on thin-films. Further, it now demonstrates physical principles with simulations in the well-known AMPS computer code developed by the author. *Classic text now updated with new advances in nanomaterials and thin films that point the way to cheaper, more efficient solar energy production *Many of the detailed equations from the first edition have been shifted to appendices in order to improve readability *Important theoretical points are now accompanied by concrete demonstrations via included simulations created with the well-known AMPS computer code.

abstract = {The great challenge for designing and developing sustainable alternative energy infrastructure is in essence the same as for maintaining our present infrastructure: How can we best solve the problems of delivering energy when and where it is needed? This involves rethinking supply and demand, load balancing, and energy sourcing paradigms with a view toward local production utilizing next generation technologies. Exploiting distributed generation means designing hybrid systems based on site-specific conditions; using new technologies to leverage traditional energy sources; and minimizing transmission and distribution costs - particularly the losses associated with long-distance transmission. Load balancing in particular becomes far more tractable when viewed as a local problem of matching energy supply and demand. Looking at modern network technologies as the models for creating a new generation of energy delivery systems provides insights into how local energy production systems can be scaled up to internetworked production systems that leverage alternative energy generation based on local and sustainable resources together with traditional large scale generation. As smart grid development advances, network theory and technology provides a new model for energy systems based on a multi-dimensional energy production network rather than the outmoded single-direction, source-to-consumption model we now have. ?? 2011 IEEE.},

Using a detailed balance model with 1 sun AM1.5G illumination, we find that for single gap photovoltaic (PV) devices the maximum efficiency increases from 33.7{\%} for cells with no carrier multiplication to 44.4{\%} for cells with carrier multiplication. We also find that the maximum efficiency of an ideal two gap tandem PV device increases from 45.7{\%} to 47.7{\%} when carrier multiplication absorbers are used in the top and bottom cells. For an ideal water electrolysis two gap tandem device, the maximum conversion efficiency is 46.0{\%} using a SF top cell and a MEG bottom cell versus 40.0{\%} for top and bottom cell absorbers with no carrier multiplication. We also consider absorbers with less than ideal MEG quantum yields as are observed experimentally. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract  = {The efficiency of a solar cell can be increased by stacking multiple solar cells with a range of bandgap energies, resulting in a multijunction solar cell with a maximum theoretical efficiency limit of 86.8{\%}. III-V compound semiconductors are good candidates for fabricating such multijunction solar cells for two reasons: they can be grown with excellent material quality; and their bandgaps span a wide spectral range, mostly with direct bandgaps, implying a high absorption coefficient. These factors are the reason for the success of this technology, which has achieved 39{\%} efficiency, the highest solar-to-electric conversion efficiency of any photovoltaic device to date. This article explores the materials science of today's high-efficiency multijunction cells and describes challenges associated with new materials developments and how they may lead to next-generation, multijunction solar cell concepts.},

The kinetics and spectral distribution of the recombination radiation during and after the injection pulse have been analyzed by a theoretical model which takes into account the heating of the sample by the laser pulse as well as the decrease of the band gap which is due to the high carrier concentration. The decay of the recombination radiation signal shows that a third-order recombination process (band-to-band impact or Auger recombination) is predominant at high concentrations. The value of the Auger recombination coefficient ϒ3≈ 10-31- 4 x 10-30 cm6/s is obtained for silicon in the temperature interval 300 K-800 K. {\textcopyright} 1973 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Upon examination, J0can be identified as the recombination current density in thermal equilibrium. In many cases the same equilibrium parameter J0 can be used to describe carrier recombination under external illumination. Nevertheless, when carriers flow from the point where they are generated towards a high recombination site the value of J0that matters to solar cell operation differs from that in equilibrium. In addition, J0may in certain cases be dependent on the excess carrier concentration. We conclude by recommending that J0be referred to as a recombination parameter.},

  abstract  = {(Figure presented) Thin-film blends or bilayers of donor- and acceptor-type organic semiconductors form the core of heterojunction organic photovoltaic cells. Researchers measure the quality of photovoltaic cells based on their power conversion efficiency, the ratio of the electrical power that can be generated versus the power of incident solar radiation. The efficiency of organic solar cells has increased steadily in the last decade, currently reaching up to 6{\%}. Understanding and combating the various loss mechanisms that occur in processes from optical excitation to charge collection should lead to efficiencies on the order of 10{\%} in the near future. In organic heterojunction solar cells, the generation of photocurrent is a cascade of four steps: generation of excitons (electrically neutral bound electron-hole pairs) by photon absorption, diffusion of excitons to the heterojunction, dissociation of the excitons into free charge carriers, and transport of these carriers to the contacts. In this Account, we review our recent contributions to the understanding of the mechanisms that govern these steps. Starting from archetype donor-acceptor systems of planar small-molecule heterojunctions and solution-processed bulk heterojunctions, we outline our search for alternative materials and device architectures. We show that non-planar phthalocynanines have appealing absorption characteristics but also have reduced charge carrier transport. As a result, the donor layer needs to be ultrathin, and all layers of the device have to be tuned to account for optical interference effects. Using these optimization techniques, we illustrate cells with 3.1{\%} efficiency for the nonplanar chloroboron subphthalocyanine donor. Molecules offering a better compromise between absorption and carrier mobility should allow for further improvements. We also propose a method for increasing the exciton diffusion length by converting singlet excitons into long-lived triplets. By doping a polymer with a phosphorescent molecule, we demonstrate an increase in the exciton diffusion length of a polymer from 4 to 9 nm. If researchers can identify suitable phosphorescent dopants, this method could be employed with other materials. The carrier transport from the junction to the contacts is markedly different for a bulk heterojunction cell than for planar junction cells. Unlike for bulk heterojunction cells, the open-circuit voltage of planar-junction cells is independent of the contact work functions, as a consequence of the balance of drift and diffusion currents in these systems. This understanding helps to guide the development of new materials (particularly donor materials) that can further boost the efficiency of single-junction cells to 10{\%}. With multijunction architectures, we expect that efficiencies of 12-16{\%} could be attained, at which point organic photovoltaic cells could become an important renewable energy source. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract      = {Cu-based chalcogenides are promising materials for thin-film solar cells with more than 20{\%} measured cell efficiency. Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, the optoelectronic properties of a group of Cu-based chalcogenides Cu2-II-IV-VI4 is studied. They are then screened with the aim of identifying potential absorber materials for photovoltaic applications. The spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) introduced by Yu and Zunger [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 068701 (2012)] is used as a metric for the screening. After constructing the current-voltage curve, the SLME is calculated from the maximum power output. The role of the nature of the band gap, direct or indirect, and also of the absorptivity of the studied materials on the maximum theoretical power conversion efficiency is studied. Our results show that Cu2II-GeSe4 with II = Cd and Hg, and Cu2-II-SnS4 with II = Cd, Hg, and Zn have a higher theoretical efficiency compared with the materials currently used as absorber layer.},
