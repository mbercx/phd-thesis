Image charge effects on the trajectories of fast ions during the grazing scattering from a solid surface are discussed. It is shown that these effects can be made use of in detailed studies on charge exchange phenomena in front of a surface. In some detail we shall outline recent progress in studies on 'skipping motion' and on the neutralization of multicharged ions.},

abstract = {We discuss recent advances in the area of plasmon excitations in ion-solid interactions. The basic aspects of plasmons are described, including surface modes. Kinetic plasmon excitation, a major contribution to the energy loss of fast charges in matter, should occur above a threshold ion velocity of ∼1.3 times the Fermi velocity. The unexpected observation of sub-threshold excitation is analyzed with the conclusion that the usually dominant mechanism is indirect excitation by fast secondary electrons. Slow ions with sufficiently high potential energy can excite multipole surface plasmons, as evidenced by the plasmon decay structure in the electron emission spectra. {\textcopyright} 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Experimental results concerning electron ejection from the atomically clean (111) face of nickel by singly charged ions of He, Ne, and Ar are reported. Total yield and kinetic-energy distribution of ejected electrons were measured as functions of ion energy in the range 4 to 100 eV. Revised experimental procedures have made it possible to extend the range of useful incident ion energies from the previous 10-eV lower limit down to 4 eV. Significant differences in the electron energy distributions are observed for ions whose energies differ by as little as 1 eV. The measured electron energy distributions were found to be markedly different from those observed for silicon and germanium as well as for tungsten and molybdenum. This is the result of differing state densities in the filled bands of these materials. The basic features of the results are only briefly discussed, since more extensive interpretive material will be subsequently reported. Data demonstrating the cleanness of the surface and the effects of adsorption of oxygen, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen are also presented. {\textcopyright} 1965 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The influence of different parameters on the discharge voltage, measured during planar magnetron sputtering, is studied for three different magnetron configurations. Using twelve different target materials, the influence of the material dependent ion-induced secondary electron emission (ISEE) coefficient is studied. An inversely proportional relation between the ISEE coefficient and the discharge voltage was found. Moreover, the discharge voltage increases with decreasing pressure, a behaviour which can be understood from the increasing recapture of electrons by the target. Furthermore, the influence of the magnetic field (target thickness) was investigated. A stronger magnetic field results in a better confinement of the electrons, resulting in a decrease of the discharge voltage at constant current. The current-vo ltage (I-V) characteristics of the three magnetron configurations was studied in a wide range of pressures and magnetic fields. The I-V characteristics are fitted to the relation I = $\beta$(V-V0)2. The value of $\beta$ expresses the steepness of the I-V characteristic and its value depends strongly on the ISEE coefficients. Of special interest is the influence of the pressure on $\beta$: Whereas at low magnetic fields $\beta$ increases with increasing pressure, it decreases with increasing pressure at strong magnetic fields. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract  = {The effective work functions ($\phi${\{}symbol{\}}+, $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}e and $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}-) for positive-ionic, electronic, and negative-ionic emissions from mono- and polycrystalline surfaces are surveyed comprehensively and also investigated critically for the main purposes of (1) evaluating the most probable values of $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}+, $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}e and $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}- for a variety of surface species, (2) explicating both thermionic contrasts ($\Delta$$\phi${\{}symbol{\}}* ≡ $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}+ - $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}e and $\Delta$$\phi${\{}symbol{\}}** ≡ $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}- - $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}e) and their dependence on experimental conditions, and (3) demonstrating the necessity of employing $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}+ (not $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}e) for quantitative analysis of those data on positive ion emission from polycrystalline surfaces. Careful examination of both theoretical results and experimental data on the work functions yield several conclusions. By both theory and experiment, clean monocrystalline surfaces are verified to have $\Delta$$\phi${\{}symbol{\}}* = 0.0 eV within an error of ±0.05 eV. Next, as the density of local surface irregularities increases, the homogeneity in the work function over the whole surface area decreases and, hence, $\Delta$$\phi${\{}symbol{\}}* increases. Also, the most probable values of $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}+ and $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}e are recommended for many mono- and polycrystalline surfaces, mostly (∼70{\%}) with a standard deviation of ±0.02-0.08 eV. Compared with the probable or typical values of $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}e accepted in influential handbooks, the most probable values of $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}e recommended here are typically (∼70{\%}) equal to each other within a narrow gap of less than ∼0.1 eV, but some (∼20{\%}) are different by ∼0.2 eV or more (up to ∼1 eV). Furthermore, polycrystalline surfaces of Nb, Mo, Ta, W, Re, Ir, Pt, etc. hold $\Delta$$\phi${\{}symbol{\}}* ≈ 0.3-0.8 eV since each surface has a mean value that is different between $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}+ and $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}e. Also, at the degree of monocrystallization ($\delta$m) below ∼50{\%}, the theoretical value of $\Delta$$\phi${\{}symbol{\}}* depends little on $\delta$m and agrees well with experimental data on each polycrystalline surface. As $\delta$m increases beyond ∼80{\%}, $\Delta$$\phi${\{}symbol{\}}* decreases rapidly to 0, showing again a good agreement between theory and experiment. In particular, those surfaces of $\delta$m {\textgreater} 97{\%} generally have $\Delta$$\phi${\{}symbol{\}}* ≈ 0 within the uncertainty of about ±0.05 eV, which is apparently equivalent to the usually called "monocrystalline surfaces ($\delta$m = 100{\%})". Additionally, even when both $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}+ and $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}e are changed by up to ∼1 eV by gas adsorption, $\Delta$$\phi${\{}symbol{\}}* itself remains little changed and, thus, the so-called "work function ($\phi${\{}symbol{\}})" recommended with polycrystalline surfaces in handbooks should not be cited as $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}+ since $\phi${\{}symbol{\}} usually coincides with $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}e except where otherwise stated. In the case of polycrystalline surfaces, $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}+ instead of $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}e should always be adopted to analyze accurately data on any positive ion emission, irrespective of its process or mechanism. Also, those metals covered with a two-dimensional graphitic film usually have $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}+ ≈ $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}e ≈ 4.5 eV, which corresponds to monocrystal graphite. Finally, for any species of mono- and polycrystalline surfaces, both theory and experiment verify $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}- = $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}e and hence, $\Delta$$\phi${\{}symbol{\}}** = 0. The features of dissociative self-surface ionization of heated ionic crystals are outlined together with typical data on $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}+, $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}- and $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}e, which originate from the thermionic properties of the crystal itself. A brief description is given to typical methods and techniques to prepare clean and/or monocrystalline surfaces, to determine local work functions of real monocrystalline surfaces, and also to form graphitic carbon films on various surfaces. In 12 tables and 29 figures based on 1350 references published to date (mainly ∼1970-2006), we show data on each work function of mono- and polycrystalline surfaces and their temperature coefficient, as well as their dependence upon experimental conditions. Also, we illustrate a comparison of each work function between theory and experiment and the most probable values of $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}+ and $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}e(=$\phi${\{}symbol{\}}-), which are generally citable as reliable references. A comparison between the most probable values ($\phi${\{}symbol{\}}e) recommended here and the probable or typical ones ($\phi${\{}symbol{\}}) accepted elsewhere are shown, along with working conditions for keeping $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}+ as high as possible for promoting positive ionization efficiency. Also, we present relationships between $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}+ and ionic desorption energies, and typical data on negative ion emission due to thermal stimulation. Thus, we provide an extensive and up-to-date database of the effective work functions of both mono- and polycrystalline surfaces, and also summarize their peculiarities governing the emissions of positive and negative ions and electrons. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A new mechanism is proposed for electron capture by ions scattered from metal surfaces, wherein a surface plasmon is excited during the capture process. The matrix element for this process and resultant neutral fraction are calculated for a simple model of electron capture to the hydrogen 1s state by a low-energy (few keV) proton incident on jellium. It is found that the transition rate for this capture channel is competitive with those for the previously-considered resonance tunneling and Auger channels. The calculation uses a novel second-quantization representation wherein terms equivalent to orthogonalization of the continuum metal and bound atomic wave functions arise naturally from a canonical transformation. These orthogonalization corrections are found to be important, suggesting that their omission is some previous resonance tunneling and Auger calculations may not be justified. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Electrons ejected from atomically clean metals by slow ions of the noble gases arise in Auger transitions which involve either the direct neutralization of the ion or the de-excitation of an excited atom. A theory of these processes is presented in which the form of the distribution in energy and relative total yield, $\gamma$i, of ejected electrons are derived. Matrix elements are not evaluated from first principles, but specific use of experimental results at two points in the theory leads to a determination of the dependence of the matrix element on distance between the atomic particle and the metal surface and the angle between the excited electron's velocity and the surface normal. Inclusion of the effects of variation of atomic energy levels near the metal surface and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle makes it possible to account in some detail for the experimentally observed energy distributions as well as the variation of these and of $\gamma$i with ion kinetic energy. The effect upon the resonance ionization and neutralization processes of the variation of atomic energy levels near the metal surface has also been investigated. The theory predicts a critical distance from the metal surface outside which resonance neutralization and inside which resonance ionization are possible. It has also been possible for the specific case of noble gas ions on tungsten, used as an illustrative example, to determine the relative proportion of electrons ejected by each of the possible Auger processes, to estimate $\gamma$i values for ions incident upon a metal with thermal energies, and to fix limits on the width of the filled portion of the conduction band in the metal. The role of the state density function in the metal and the effect of possible variation of the matrix element with electron energy in the band are also investigated. {\textcopyright} 1954 The American Physical Society.},

This distribution exhibits both collective interaction characteristics and individual interaction characteristics, and is more general than the result obtained by other workers. Describing the conduction electrons by the hydro-dynamical equations of Bloch, it has been shown that for very thin idealized foils energy loss may occur at a value which is less than the plasma energy, while as the foil thickness decreases below ∼v$\omega$p the loss at the plasma energy becomes less than that predicted by more conventional theories. The net result is an increase in the energy loss per unit thickness as the foil thickness is decreased. It is suggested that the predicted loss at subplasma energies may correspond to some of the low-lying energy losses which have been observed by experimenters using thin foils. {\textcopyright} 1957 The American Physical Society.},

  abstract  = {Atmospheric-pressure, non-equilibrium plasmas are susceptible to instabilities and, in particular, to arcing (glow-to-arc transition). Spatially confining the plasma to dimensions of 1 mm or less is a promising approach to the generation and maintenance of stable, glow discharges at atmospheric-pressure. Often referred to as microdischarges or microplasmas, these weakly-ionized discharges represent a new and fascinating realm of plasma science, where issues such as the possible breakdown of 'pd scaling' and the role of boundary-dominated phenomena come to the fore. Microplasmas are generated under conditions that promote the efficient production of transient molecular species such as the rare gas excimers, which generally are formed by three-body collisions. Pulsed excitation on a sub-microsecond time scale results in microplasmas with significant shifts in both the temperatures and energy distribution functions associated with the ions and electrons. This allows for the selective production of chemically reactive species and opens the door to a wide range of new applications of microplasmas. The implementation of semiconductor and microelectronics and MEMs microfabrication techniques has resulted in the realization of microplasma arrays as large as 250,000 devices. Fabricated in silicon or ceramics with characteristic device dimensions as small as 10 $\nu$m and at packing densities up to 10 4 cm -2 , these arrays offer optical and electrical characteristics well suited for applications in medical diagnostics, displays and environmental sensing. Several microplasma device structures, including their fundamental properties and selected applications, will be discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract      = {Electron and energy transfer processes between an atom or molecule and a surface are extremely important for many applications in physics and chemistry. Therefore a profound understanding of these processes is essential in order to analyze a large variety of physical systems. The microscopic description of the two-electron Auger processes, leading to neutralization/ionization of an ion/neutral atom in front of a solid surface, has been a long-standing problem. It can be dated back to the 1950s when H.D. Hagstrum proposed to use the information contained in the spectrum of the electrons emitted during the neutralization of slow noble gas ions as a surface analytical tool complementing photoelectron spectroscopy. However, only recently a comprehensive description of the Auger neutralization mechanism has been achieved by the combined efforts of theoretical and experimental methods. In this article we review the theoretical models for this problem, stressing how their outcome compare with experimental results. We also analyze the inverse problem of Auger ionization. We emphasize the understanding of the key quantities governing the processes and outline the challenges remaining. This opens new perspectives for future developments of theoretical and experimental work in this field. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The two-electron, Auger-type transitions which occur when an ion of sufficiently large ionization energy is neutralized at the atomically clean surface of a diamond-type semiconductor are discussed. Consideration of the basic elements of the problem leads to a computing program which enables one to calculate the total electron yield and kinetic energy distribution of ejected electrons in terms of a number of parameters. It is possible to account for the experimental results for singly-charged noble gas ions incident on the (111) faces of Si and Ge and the (100) face of Si. The fit of theory to experiment is unique in its principal features yielding numerical results concerning: (1) the state density function for the valence bands of Si and Ge, (2) the energy dependence of the matrix element as it is determined by symmetry of the valence band wave functions, (3) the effective ionization energy near the solid surface, (4) energy broadening, and (5) electron escape over the surface barrier. Over-all width of the valence band is found to be 14-16 ev for both Si and Ge. Width of the degenerate p bands is 5.1 ev in Si, 4.3 ev in Ge. The matrix element for p-type valence electrons is 0.3 times that for s-type valence electrons. Effective ionization energy is 2.2 ev less than the free-space value for 10-ev He+ ions and decreases linearly with ion velocity. Energy broadening is small for 10-ev ions and increases approximately linearly with ion velocity. Probability of electron escape is several times that predicted for an isotropic distribution of excited electrons incident on a plane surface barrier. A general theory of Auger neutralization is given in which the conclusions of the fit to experiment are interpreted. Investigation of the matrix element as a Coulomb interaction integral involving wave functions whose general characteristics are known but which are not explicitly evaluated leads to an understanding of its principal dependences on energy and angle. {\textcopyright} 1961 The American Physical Society.},

When an ion is near the surface, we propose a local model in which free-electron-gas quantities are scaled through the local electronic density at the ion position n(z). It is shown that the results of this local model can be joined to the results of a totally surface calculation, valid when the ion is far from the surface. We have calculated Auger neutralization rates and electron emission spectra for He+ ions interacting with a jellium surface of rs=2.67a0. The effect of the ion potential on the metal-electron wave functions can be incorporated into the model by means of the effective density setup by the tunneling electrons. Its effect is found to be crucial when comparing our results with available experimental data for He+ scattered off Cu surfaces.

A model has been developed to calculate an effective secondary-electron-emission coefficient $\gamma$ in Penning mixtures as a function of the insulator-energy-band parameters. Incorporation of the calculated $\gamma$ into the breakdown criterion results in good agreement between calculated and measured voltage-breakdown curves for differently prepared MgO cathode surfaces. The calculated results show that the value of $\gamma$ for argon ions depends on the state of the MgO surface, and this occurs through a change in the width of the band gap of MgO. The results also show that a nonzero value of $\gamma$ (Ar+) significantly lowers the breakdown voltages and changes the shape of the breakdown curves at higher values of P0d.},

  abstract  = {Total yield and kinetic energy distribution have been measured for electrons ejected from atomically clean and gas covered molybdenum by the ions He+, He++, and He2+ in the kinetic energy range 10 to 1000 ev. Evidence is presented that one electron is excited into the kinetic energy continuum for each incident He+ ion and that the electrons so excited are partially internally reflected at the potential barrier of the metal. The slowest ions observed were found to eject 0.25, 0.72, and 0.13 electron per ion for He+, He++, and He2+, respectively. Total electron yield is found to be nearly independent of ion kinetic energy up to 1000 ev. This observation and that of the kinetic energy maximum for slow ions indicate that the electrons are released in an Auger type process for which the energy is supplied by the potential and not the kinetic energy of the ion (potential ejection). Electrons of kinetic energy greater than the upper limit predicted by present theory are observed for faster ions and are accounted for by the shift of the energy levels of the bombarding particle when it is near the metal surface. Some conclusions concerning reflection processes at a metal surface and the nature of electron ejection by the alpha-particle (He++) and the molecular helium ion (He2+) come out of this work. {\textcopyright} 1953 The American Physical Society.},

MHCD's have been proposed for a number of applications based on their unique characteristics such as presence of intense excimer radiation and significant gas heating within the submillimeter discharge volume. A two-dimensional, self-consistent fluid model of a helium MHCD in the high-pressure (several hundreds of Torr), high-current (∼1 mA) operating regime is presented in this study. Results indicate that the MHCD operates in an abnormal glow discharge mode with charged and excited metastable species with densities of ∼10 20m -3, electron temperatures of approximately tens of eV, and gas temperatures of hundreds of Kelvin above room temperature. Significant discharge activity exists outside of the hollow region. The discharge volume and intensity increases with increasing current and becomes more confined with increasing pressures. Most predictions presented in this paper are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with experimental data for MHCD's under similar conditions. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

The dynamics of cylindrical, metal-dielectric-metal sandwich MDs sustained in Ar having characteristic sizes of a few hundred micrometres have been computationally investigated using a plasma-transport model which includes gas dynamics. We found that these devices closely resemble negative glow discharges, as they are sustained by, and particularly sensitive to, ionization resulting from secondary electron emission from the cathode. Since these MDs operate on a cw basis with large current densities and power deposition, gas heating and flow dynamics are important considerations in optimizing their electrical and kinetic properties. For example, the formation of excimer species is particularly sensitive to gas heating and rarefaction due to their dependence on three-body formation processes. Scalings of MDs with pressure, current and secondary emission coefficient are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

They are compared to experimental values by performing a linear regression, which results in a measure of the predictable and material-specific error of the theoretical result. Two of the most prevalent functionals, the local density approximation (LDA) and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof parametrization of the generalized gradient approximation (PBE-GGA), are evaluated and compared. Both LDA and GGA-PBE are found to yield accurate work functions with error bars below 0.3 eV, rivaling the experimental precision. LDA also provides satisfactory estimates for the surface energy with error bars smaller than 10{\%}, but GGA-PBE significantly underestimates the surface energy for materials with a large correlation energy.},

abstract = {An elementary theory is developed for the process by which a helium ion or a 2S3 metastable helium atom may extract an electron from a metal surface. The helium ion after collision may become a neutral atom although sometimes an excited or even a metastable atom. In the case of the metastable atom the collision involves an exchange of electrons between the metal and the atom, the excess energy being carried away by the ejected L shell electron. The average distance of transition s̄ for He+ and for the 2S3 metastable helium atom is calculated for different velocities. For v=105 cm/sec., s̄met=2a0 and s̄ion=11.5a0 where a0=0.528×0-8 cm. For v=3×107 cm/sec., s̄met comes out less than 0.1a0 and s̄ion=6.0a0. These values are different from the values obtained by Massey in a similar computation. The theory accounts for some but not all of the experimental evidence. The probable shape of the potential that the metal surface offers to a metastable atom is found. {\textcopyright} 1944 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The most widely used oxide for photocatalytic applications owing to its low cost and high activity is TiO2. The discovery of the photolysis of water on the surface of TiO2 in 1972 launched four decades of intensive research into the underlying chemical and physical processes involved. Despite much collected evidence, a thoroughly convincing explanation of why mixed-phase samples of anatase and rutile outperform the individual polymorphs has remained elusive. One long-standing controversy is the energetic alignment of the band edges of the rutile and anatase polymorphs of TiO2 (ref.). We demonstrate, through a combination of state-of-the-art materials simulation techniques and X-ray photoemission experiments, that a type-II, staggered, band alignment of ∼ 0.4 eV exists between anatase and rutile with anatase possessing the higher electron affinity, or work function. Our results help to explain the robust separation of photoexcited charge carriers between the two phases and highlight a route to improved photocatalysts. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This probability depends crucially on the distance between ion and surface. It is shown that for large and intermediate distances the energy transferred to the metal in the neutralization process is predominantly used to excite surface plasmons bulk plasmons are seen in the spectrum only for short distances. Using a simple model for the metal surface, the derivative of the electron emission spectrum is calculated for three model ions simulating He+, Ne+ and Ar+ +scattered off Al.

These oscillations are caused by quasi-resonant neutralization (qRN), a process which is active for materials with a narrow band nearly resonant with the unperturbed He 1s-level. In this paper we measure the fraction of He+ backscattered from Ge(100). In conjunction with recently developed theoretical methods, we extract quantitative information on the efficiency of qRN. Our evaluation reveals that qRN is a highly efficient process leading to ion fractions two orders of magnitude lower than in systems for which neutralization is only due to Auger processes. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) is an analytical technique that measures the change in kinetic energy of electrons after they have interacted with a specimen. When carried out in a modern transmission electron microscope, EELS is capable of giving structural and chemical information about a solid, with a spatial resolution down to the atomic level in favourable cases. The energy resolution is typically 1 eV but can approach 0.1 eV if an electron-beam monochromator is used. This review provides an overview of EELS instrumentation and of the physics involved in the scattering of kilovolt electrons in solids. Features of the energy-loss spectrum are discussed, including plasmon peaks, inner-shell ionization edges and fine structure related to the electronic densities of states. Examples are given of the use of EELS for the measurement of local properties, including specimen thickness, mechanical and electronic properties (such as bandgap) and chemical composition. Factors that determine the spatial resolution of the analysis are outlined, including radiation damage to the specimen. Comparisons are made with related techniques, particularly x-ray absorption spectroscopy. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Secondary electron emission yield $\gamma$ values for rare-gas particles (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe ions of atoms and molecules, metastable atoms, and excimers) of MgO deposited under optimum conditions for the highest $\gamma$ values were calculated assuming the Auger transitions between the valence band, and the F (oxygen ion vacancy + two electrons) and F+ (oxygen ion vacancy + one electron) centers in the MgO surface. These calculated $\gamma$ values are probably the same as $\gamma$ values for MgO used in practice. As for combination of the MgO with these rare-gas particles, all the calculated $\gamma$ values fall to nonzero; resonance neutralization cannot occur for the rare-gas particles except Ne and Xe2 ions. Therefore, $\gamma$ values of the MgO for these rare-gas particles, other than Ne and Xe2 ions, are determined only by Auger neutralization. For Ne and Xe2 ions, the influence of resonance neutralization effect on calculated $\gamma$ values of ions is small. Therefore, $\gamma$ values of the MgO for Ne and Xe2 ions are also almost determined only by Auger neutralization. The $\gamma$ values for the ions of atoms are a little larger than those for the ions of molecules. The $\gamma$ values of the metastable atoms are also a little larger than those of the excimers. As for MgO without defect states, calculated $\gamma$ values of Ar, Kr, and Xe ions of atoms and molecules fall to zero; calculated $\gamma$ value of Xe2 excimer at the lowest continuous spectrum also falls to zero; these calculated $\gamma$ values for MgO without defect states are probably the lowest values theoretically. As for rare-gas ions of atoms, the calculated $\gamma$ values have been compared with experimental results reported previously.

We employ quantum-kinetic equations for the projectile Green functions in the finite-U noncrossing approximation. Our results for $\alpha$ agree reasonably well with the experimental data as far as the overall order of magnitude is concerned, showing in particular the correlation-induced enhancement of $\alpha$. The experimentally found nonmonotonous temperature dependence, however, could not be reproduced. Instead of an initially increasing and then decreasing $\alpha$, we find over the whole temperature range only a weak negative temperature dependence. It arises, however, clearly from a mixed-valence resonance in the projectile's spectral density and thus supports qualitatively the interpretation of the experimental data in terms of a mixed-valence scenario.},

abstract = {A new method of spectroscopy of solids is presented. By means of it, information concerning the state densities in solids is extracted from measured kinetic-energy distributions of electrons ejected from the solid by slow noble-gas ions. The basic electronic process involved is the radiationless, two-electron, Augertype transition which neutralizes the ion to its ground state at the atomically clean solid surface and simultaneously excites another electron in the solid. The method starts with measured energy distributions and, making a minimum of assumptions, works its way back to what may be called the transition density function. This function, which specifies the relative probability that an electron at a given band energy will be involved in the neutralization process, depends on state densities in initial and final states of the process, transition probability, final-state interaction, and other factors. The information obtained is of the same general kind as that obtained by soft-x-ray spectroscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy. When the surface is atomically clean the transition density involves bulk-state densities and transition probabilities which depend on the surface. For surfaces with monolayers involving foreign atoms, the transition density is modified by the state-density and wave-function changes resulting from the presence of the two-dimensional surface crystal. The method, feasibility, and characteristics of the ion-neutralization spectroscopy are discussed using experimental data for copper and nickel as illustrative examples. Experimental apparatus and operating conditions are discussed only briefly. {\textcopyright} 1966 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Measurements of the energy distributions and energy-resolved polarizations of electrons ejected by incident polarized (formula presented) ions are used to probe the dynamics of (formula presented) ion neutralization at clean Al(100), Au(100), and Cu(100) surfaces for incident ion energies in the range 10–500 eV. The results are interpreted using recent theory and suggest that neutralization occurs at typical atom/surface separations of ∼2–3 a.u., significantly smaller than those inferred from earlier experimental studies of ion scattering and ion neutralization at surfaces. Close to the surface strong short-range repulsive interactions become important and lead to increases in the maximum energy of the ejected electrons and to a spin-dependent increase in the local density of electronic states near the Fermi energy. {\textcopyright} 2003 The American Physical Society.},

  abstract  = {We report on studies of plasmon excitation in Mg under the impact of slow He+ ions in the incident energy range 0.1-0.5 keV. Consistent with studies on Al surfaces, a transition from surface to bulk plasmon excitation occurs as the energy of the ion is increased. Previous methods in the literature to obtain information about yields of electron emission from plasmon decay are discussed. A new data analysis procedure is presented, which allows disentangling the contributions to the experimental spectra arising from different emission mechanisms, showing that potential excitation of multipole surface plasmons gives an important contribution to electron emission. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract  = {The discharge voltage is perhaps the most accessible parameter of the magnetron sputter deposition process. As its value can be easily monitored, research reports generally contain its value. Nevertheless, the interpretation of the discharge voltage and/or its behavior, especially during reactive magnetron sputtering, is less straightforward. To understand its behavior, it is necessary to look into the details of the magnetron discharge, the processes occurring at the cathode (or target) and the influence of the important discharge parameters such as discharge current, magnet configuration, and discharge gas pressure. The influence of these parameters can be partially understood from a general formula. This formula, based on the original work of Thornton, shows that the discharge voltage behavior during reactive magnetron sputtering finds its origin in the formation of a compound layer on the target. The discharge voltage behavior depends strongly on the material properties of the compound layer which is formed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
