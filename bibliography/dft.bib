  abstract  = {An efficient method is presented for finding minimum energy paths and, in particular, the saddle point energy for a transition between given initial and final configurations of atoms. The method is applicable to transitions involving concerted motion of several atoms and large systems. An elastic band stretching between the two endpoint configurations is optimized until the band traces out the minimum energy path using a discrete representation which is largely decoupled from the motion of the band. Applications to diffusion of adatoms on surfaces (using both Lennard-Jones and Embedded Atom Method potentials) are presented to illustrate the convergence properties of the method.},

  abstract  = {From a theory of Hohenberg and Kohn, approximation methods for treating an inhomogeneous system of interacting electrons are developed. These methods are exact for systems of slowly varying or high density. For the ground state, they lead to self-consistent equations analogous to the Hartree and Hartree-Fock equations, respectively. In these equations the exchange and correlation portions of the chemical potential of a uniform electron gas appear as additional effective potentials. (The exchange portion of our effective potential differs from that due to Slater by a factor of 2/3.) Electronic systems at finite temperatures and in magnetic fields are also treated by similar methods. An appendix deals with a further correction for systems with short-wavelength density oscillations.},

The method allows high-quality first-principles molecular-dynamics calculations to be performed using the original fictitious Lagrangian approach of Car and Parrinello. Like the LAPW method it can be used to treat first-row and transition-metal elements with affordable effort and provides access to the full wave function. The augmentation procedure is generalized in that partial-wave expansions are not determined by the value and the derivative of the envelope function at some muffin-tin radius, but rather by the overlap with localized projector functions. The pseudopotential approach based on generalized separable pseudopotentials can be regained by a simple approximation. {\textcopyright} 1994 The American Physical Society.},

  abstract  = {Density Functional Theory (DFT) is one of the most widely used methods for "ab initio" calculations of the structure of atoms, molecules, crystals, surfaces, and their interactions. Unfortunately, the customary introduction to DFT is often considered too lengthy to be included in various curricula. An alternative introduction to DFT is presented here, drawing on ideas which are well-known from thermodynamics, especially the idea of switching between different independent variables. The central theme of DFT, i.e. the notion that it is possible and beneficial to replace the dependence on the external potential v(r) by a dependence on the density distribution n(r), is presented as a straightforward generalization of the familiar Legendre transform from the chemical potential ($\backslash$mu) to the number of particles (N). This approach is used here to introduce the Hohenberg-Kohn energy functional and to obtain the corresponding theorems, using classical nonuniform fluids as simple examples. The energy functional for electronic systems is considered next, and the Kohn-Sham equations are derived. The exchange-correlation part of this functional is discussed, including both the local density approximation to it, and its formally exact expression in terms of the exchange-correlation hole. A very brief survey of various applications and extensions is included.},

  title    = {{The linear response function in density functional theory: Optical spectra and improved description of the electron correlation}},
  school   = {University of Vienna},
  year     = {2008},
  abstract = {The linear response function, which describes the change in the electron density induced by a change in the external potential, is the basis for a broad variety of applications. Three of these are addressed in the present thesis. In the first part, optical spectra of metallic surfaces are investigated. Quasiparticle energies, i.e., energies required to add or remove an electron from a system, are evaluated for selected metals in the second part. The final part of this thesis is devoted to an improved description of the ground-state electron correlation energy. In the first part, the linear response function is used to evaluate optical properties of metallic surfaces. In recent years, reflectance difference (RD) spectroscopy has provided a sensitive experimental method to detect changes in the surface structure and morphology. The interpretation of the resulting spectra, which are linked to the anisotropy of the surface dielectric tensor, however, is often difficult. In the present thesis, we simulate RD spectra for the bare, as well as oxygen and carbon monoxide covered, Cu(110) surface, and assign features in these spectra to the corresponding optical transitions. A good qualitative agreement between our RD spectra and the experimental data is found. Density functional theory (DFT) gives only access to the ground state energy. Quasiparticle energies should, however, be addressed within many body perturbation theory. In the second part of this thesis, we investigate quasiparticle energies for the transition metals Cu, Ag, Fe, and Ni using the Green's function based GW approximation, where the screened Coulomb interaction W is linked to the linear response function. The fundamental limitation of density function theory is the approximation of the exchange-correlation energy. An exact expression for the exchange-correlation energy can be found by the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem (ACFDT), linking the linear response function to the electron correlation energy. This expression has been implemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). Technical issues and ACFDT results obtained for molecules and extended systems, are addressed in the third and last part of this thesis. Although we make use of the random phase approximation (RPA), we find that the correct long-range van der Waals interaction for rare gas solids is reproduced and geometrical properties for insulators, semiconductors, and metals are in very good agreement with experiment. Atomization energies, however, are not significantly improved compared to standard DFT functionals like PBE.},

The attraction of the nuclei for the electrons is the only attractive force in a molecule and is the force responsible for the bonding between atoms. This is the attractive force acting on the electrons in the Ehrenfest force and on the nuclei in the Feynman force, one that is countered by the repulsion between the electrons in the former and by the repulsion between the nuclei in the latter. The virial theorem relates these forces to the energy changes resulting from interactions between atoms. All bonding, as signified by the presence of a bond path, has a common origin in terms of the mechanics determined by the Ehrenfest, Feynman and virial theorems.

Using a screened Coulomb potential for Hartree-Fock exchange enables fast and accurate hybrid calculations, even of usually difficult metallic systems.

Higher rungs or levels incorporate increasingly complex ingredients constructed from the d. or the Kohn-Sham orbitals in or around this vol. element. We identify which addnl. exact conditions can be satisfied at each level, and discuss the extent to which the functionals at each level may be constructed without empirical input. We also discuss the research that remains to be done at the exact-exchange level, and present our "dreams of a final theory". "Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran. He came to a certain place and stayed there for the night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place. And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reaching to heaven; and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.". on SciFinder (R)},

abstract = {With its extreme accuracy and reasonable computational efficiency, the linearized augmented plane wave (LAPW) method has emerged as the standard by which density functional calculations for transition metal and rare-earth containing materials are judged. The second edition of Planewaves, Pseudopotentials and the LAPW Method presents an updated, thorough and self-contained exposition of the first principles methods for calculating properties of solids, in particular the "LAPW" method and will make connections between this method and planewave pseudopotential approaches.Theory is discussed, but the emphasis is on how practical implementation proceeds. In addition, the author suggests future directions for adapting the LAPW method to simulations of complex materials requiring large unit cells. He does this by elucidating the connections between the LAPW method and planewave pseudopotential approaches and by showing how Car-Parrinello type algorithms can be adapted to the LAPW method. The new edition contains new sections on developments over the last 10 years, including for example the LDA+U method, non-collinear magnetism and the APW+LO method.},

Perdew and Wang have developed a GGA based on real-space cutoff of the spurious long-range components of the second-order gradient expansion for the exchange-correlation hole. We have found that this density functional performs well in numerical tests for a variety of systems: (1) Total energies of 30 atoms are highly accurate. (2) Ionization energies and electron affinities are improved in a statistical sense, although significant interconfigurational and interterm errors remain. (3) Accurate atomization energies are found for seven hydrocarbon molecules, with a rms error per bond of 0.1 eV, compared with 0.7 eV for the LSD approximation and 2.4 eV for the Hartree-Fock approximation. (4) For atoms and molecules, there is a cancellation of error between density functionals for exchange and correlation, which is most striking whenever the Hartree-Fock result is furthest from experiment. (5) The surprising LSD underestimation of the lattice constants of Li and Na by 3–4 {\%} is corrected, and the magnetic ground state of solid Fe is restored. (6) The work function, surface energy (neglecting the long-range contribution), and curvature energy of a metallic surface are all slightly reduced in comparison with LSD. Taking account of the positive long-range contribution, we find surface and curvature energies in good agreement with experimental or exact values. Finally, a way is found to visualize and understand the nonlocality of exchange and correlation, its origins, and its physical effects.},

  abstract      = {We present ab initio quantum-mechanical molecular-dynamics calculations based on the calculation of the electronic ground state and of the Hellmann-Feynman forces in the local-density approximation at each molecular-dynamics step. This is possible using conjugate-gradient techniques for energy minimization, and predicting the wave functions for new ionic positions using sub-space alignment. This approach avoids the instabilities inherent in quantum-mechanical molecular-dynamics calculations for metals based on the use of a fictitious Newtonian dynamics for the electronic degrees of freedom. This method gives perfect control of the adiabaticity and allows us to perform simulations over several picoseconds. A few years ago Car and Parrinello introduced an approach that unifies molecular-dynamics techniques for the calculation of the atomic structure with the local-density approximation2 (LDA) for electronic structure calculations, with the complete set of quantum-mechanical many-body forces calculated using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. The basic idea is the introduction of a fictitious dynamics for the electronic degrees of freedom. Since the electronic wave functions of the LDA are meaningful only if the electrons are in their ground state for the instantaneous ionic configuration , an essential condition for the practicability of the Car-Parrinello method is that the transfer of energy between the atomic and electronic subsystems is small in order to prevent the electron states to drift away from the ground states. This transfer of energy is difBcult to control in metallic systems. In insulators, the width of the electronic band gap divided by the fictitious mass of the electronic degrees of freedom defines the separation in the characteristic frequencies of the atomic and electronic motions. In metals, this separation is absent and there are essentially two mechanisms that drive metallic systems into nonadiabaticity: a resonance between the atomic and electronic frequencies opening a channel for energy transfer and a level crossing between occupied and empty electron states. s The operational solution of these nonadiabaticity problems is (a) to perform periodic energy minimizations to bring the system "back to the Born-Oppenheimer surface" or (b) to attach the electronic subsystem to a Nose thermostat that prevents the heating up of the electron system. s Clearly the alternative is to perform the minimization of the Kohn-Sham functional for the electronic total energy at any time step of the molecular-dynamics simulation, so that the problem of the nonadiabaticity does not arise at all. An efficient way to perform the minimization process are conjugate-gradient methods. These techniques have now been developed to a point were it is possible to perform canonical molecular-dynamics simulations for liquid metals over periods of several picoseconds, with complete control over deviations from adiabaticity and good energy conservation. Applications for liquid metals ranging from Na to Ge demonstrate very good agreement with the measured atomic structure factors and electronic spectra. Our technique for performing a complete calculation of the LDA ground state after each molecular-dynamics step is based on the conjugate-gradient techniques developed by Payne and co-workers. s s and used in self-consistent electronic structure calculations by Bylander, Kleinman, and Lee. s io The method is a doubly iterative one: in the inner loop the wave functions for each k point in the Brillouin zone and each band are improved by a preconditioned conjugate-gradient method as described in Ref. 9 until the change in the energy eigenvalue is smaller than 10 s eV (or smaller than 30{\%} of the change in the first step). After running over all bands (includ-ing some empty bands), a subspace diagonalization is performed, the new Fermi energy is calculated using a Gaussian broadening of the energy levels, and the charge density is updated. The problems arising from using fractional occupation numbers and their consequences for ab initio molecular-dynamics simulations have been discussed by Weinert and Davenportii and by Wentzcov-itch, Martins, and Allen. i2 It has been shown that the variational quantity is not the internal energy but a generalized free energy. To prevent charge sloshing, the mixing scheme proposed by Kerkeris is used. This scheme has the advantage of damping the oscillations in the low-q components of the charge density. The electronic-energy minimization is terminated when the change in the energy per atom becomes smaller than 1.5 x 10 s eV. The atomic motion is described by Nosh dynamicsi4 generating a canonical ensemble at prefixed temperature. The equations of motion are integrated using a fourth-order predictor-corrector algorithmis' s which allows the use of time steps as large as 3 x 10 s with good energy conservation. After moving the atoms, the new wave functions are estimated by using the subspace alignment proposed by Arias, Payne, and Joannopoulos. The calculation has been performed for a nonlocal pseudopotential in Kleinman-Bylander factorization, using the real-space projection scheme of King-Smith, Payne, and Lin. 7 The first test was performed for a 54-atom ensemble 47 558},

Our simulations are based on (a) finite-temperature density-functional theory of the one-electron states, (b) exact energy minimization and hence calculation of the exact Hellmann-Feynman forces after each molecular-dynamics step using preconditioned conjugate-gradient techniques, (c) accurate nonlocal pseudopotentials, and (d) Nos{\'{e}} dynamics for generating a canonical ensemble. This method gives perfect control of the adiabaticity of the electron-ion ensemble and allows us to perform simulations over more than 30 ps. The computer-generated ensemble describes the structural, dynamic, and electronic properties of liquid and amorphous Ge in very good agreement with experiment. The simulation allows us to study in detail the changes in the structure-property relationship through the metal-semiconductor transition. We report a detailed analysis of the local structural properties and their changes induced by an annealing process. The geometrical, bonding, and spectral properties of defects in the disordered tetrahedral network are investigated and compared with experiment. {\textcopyright} 1994 The American Physical Society.},

  abstract  = {We present an efficient scheme for calculating the Kohn-Sham ground state of metallic systems using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. In the first part the application of Pulay's DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order (Formula presented) operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay's scheme. A special “metric” and a special “preconditioning” optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order (Formula presented) scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach (Formula presented). We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

The electronic and optical properties have been investigated as a function of the Coulomb repulsion parameter U. We find that the value obtained from constrained LDA (U=8 eV) is not the best possible choice, whereas an intermediate value (U=5 eV) reproduces the experimental magnetic moment and optical properties satisfactorily. At intermediate U, the nature of the band gap is a mixture of charge transfer and Mort-Hubbard type, and becomes almost purely of the charge-transfer type at higher values of U. This is due to the enhancement of the oxygen 2p states near the top of the valence states with increasing U value.},

  abstractnote = {This report is based on a SC Workshop on Computational Materials Science and Chemistry for Innovation on July 26-27, 2010, to assess the potential of state-of-the-art computer simulations to accelerate understanding and discovery in materials science and chemistry, with a focus on potential impacts in energy technologies and innovation. The urgent demand for new energy technologies has greatly exceeded the capabilities of today's materials and chemical processes. To convert sunlight to fuel, efficiently store energy, or enable a new generation of energy production and utilization technologies requires the development of new materials and processes of unprecedented functionality and performance. New materials and processes are critical pacing elements for progress in advanced energy systems and virtually all industrial technologies. Over the past two decades, the United States has developed and deployed the world's most powerful collection of tools for the synthesis, processing, characterization, and simulation and modeling of materials and chemical systems at the nanoscale, dimensions of a few atoms to a few hundred atoms across. These tools, which include world-leading x-ray and neutron sources, nanoscale science facilities, and high-performance computers, provide an unprecedented view of the atomic-scale structure and dynamics of materials and the molecular-scale basis of chemical processes. For the first time in history, we are able to synthesize, characterize, and model materials and chemical behavior at the length scale where this behavior is controlled. This ability is transformational for the discovery process and, as a result, confers a significant competitive advantage. Perhaps the most spectacular increase in capability has been demonstrated in high performance computing. Over the past decade, computational power has increased by a factor of a million due to advances in hardware and software. This rate of improvement, which shows no sign of abating, has enabled the development of computer simulations and models of unprecedented fidelity. We are at the threshold of a new era where the integrated synthesis, characterization, and modeling of complex materials and chemical processes will transform our ability to understand and design new materials and chemistries with predictive power. In turn, this predictive capability will transform technological innovation by accelerating the development and deployment of new materials and processes in products and manufacturing. Harnessing the potential of computational science and engineering for the discovery and development of materials and chemical processes is essential to maintaining leadership in these foundational fields that underpin energy technologies and industrial competitiveness. Capitalizing on the opportunities presented by simulation-based engineering and science in materials and chemistry will require an integration of experimental capabilities with theoretical and computational modeling; the development of a robust and sustainable infrastructure to support the development and deployment of advanced computational models; and the assembly of a community of scientists and engineers to implement this integration and infrastructure. This community must extend to industry, where incorporating predictive materials science and chemistry into design tools can accelerate the product development cycle and drive economic competitiveness. The confluence of new theories, new materials synthesis capabilities, and new computer platforms has created an unprecedented opportunity to implement a "materials-by-design" paradigm with wide-ranging benefits in technological innovation and scientific discovery. The Workshop on Computational Materials Science and Chemistry for Innovation was convened in Bethesda, Maryland, on July 26-27, 2010. Sponsored by the Department of Energy (DOE) Offices of Advanced Scientific Computing Research and Basic Energy Sciences, the workshop brought together 160 experts in materials science, chemistry, and computational science representing more than 65 universities, laboratories, and industries, and four agencies. The workshop examined seven foundational challenge areas in materials science and chemistry: materials for extreme conditions, self-assembly, light harvesting, chemical reactions, designer fluids, thin films and interfaces, and electronic structure. Each of these challenge areas is critical to the development of advanced energy systems, and each can be accelerated by the integrated application of predictive capability with theory and experiment. The workshop concluded that emerging capabilities in predictive modeling and simulation have the potential to revolutionize the development of new materials and chemical processes. Coupled with world-leading materials characterization and nanoscale science facilities, this predictive capability provides the foundation for an innovation ecosystem that can accelerate the discovery, development, and deployment of new technologies, including advanced energy systems. Delivering on the promise of this innovation ecosystem requires the following: Integration of synthesis, processing, characterization, theory, and simulation and modeling. Many of the newly established Energy Frontier Research Centers and Energy Hubs are exploiting this integration. Achieving/strengthening predictive capability in foundational challenge areas. Predictive capability in the seven foundational challenge areas described in this report is critical to the development of advanced energy technologies. Developing validated computational approaches that span vast differences in time and length scales. This fundamental computational challenge crosscuts all of the foundational challenge areas. Similarly challenging is coupling of analytical data from multiple instruments and techniques that are required to link these length and time scales. Experimental validation and quantification of uncertainty in simulation and modeling. Uncertainty quantification becomes increasingly challenging as simulations become more complex. Robust and sustainable computational infrastructure, including software and applications. For modeling and simulation, software equals infrastructure. To validate the computational tools, software is critical infrastructure that effectively translates huge arrays of experimental data into useful scientific understanding. An integrated approach for managing this infrastructure is essential. Efficient transfer and incorporation of simulation-based engineering and science in industry. Strategies for bridging the gap between research and industrial applications and for widespread industry adoption of integrated computational materials engineering are needed.},
