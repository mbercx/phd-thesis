abstract = {Generalized gradient approximations (GGA's) seek to improve upon the accuracy of the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation in electronic-structure calculations. Perdew and Wang have developed a GGA based on real-space cutoff of the spurious long-range components of the second-order gradient expansion for the exchange-correlation hole. We have found that this density functional performs well in numerical tests for a variety of systems: (1) Total energies of 30 atoms are highly accurate. (2) Ionization energies and electron affinities are improved in a statistical sense, although significant interconfigurational and interterm errors remain. (3) Accurate atomization energies are found for seven hydrocarbon molecules, with a rms error per bond of 0.1 eV, compared with 0.7 eV for the LSD approximation and 2.4 eV for the Hartree-Fock approximation. (4) For atoms and molecules, there is a cancellation of error between density functionals for exchange and correlation, which is most striking whenever the Hartree-Fock result is furthest from experiment. (5) The surprising LSD underestimation of the lattice constants of Li and Na by 3–4 {\%} is corrected, and the magnetic ground state of solid Fe is restored. (6) The work function, surface energy (neglecting the long-range contribution), and curvature energy of a metallic surface are all slightly reduced in comparison with LSD. Taking account of the positive long-range contribution, we find surface and curvature energies in good agreement with experimental or exact values. Finally, a way is found to visualize and understand the nonlocality of exchange and correlation, its origins, and its physical effects.},

abstract = {The formal relationship between ultrasoft (US) Vanderbilt-type pseudopotentials and Bl{\"{o}}chl's projector augmented wave (PAW) method is derived. It is shown that the total energy functional for US pseudopotentials can be obtained by linearization of two terms in a slightly modified PAW total energy functional. The Hamilton operator, the forces, and the stress tensor are derived for this modified PAW functional. A simple way to implement the PAW method in existing plane-wave codes supporting US pseudopotentials is pointed out. In addition, critical tests are presented to compare the accuracy and efficiency of the PAW and the US pseudopotential method with relaxed core all electron methods. These tests include small molecules (Formula presented) and several bulk systems (diamond, Si, V, Li, Ca, (Formula presented) Fe, Co, Ni). Particular attention is paid to the bulk properties and magnetic energies of Fe, Co, and Ni. {\textcopyright} 1999 The American Physical Society.},

The second edition of Planewaves, Pseudopotentials and the LAPW Method presents an updated, thorough and self-contained exposition of the first principles methods for calculating properties of solids, in particular the "LAPW" method and will make connections between this method and planewave pseudopotential approaches.Theory is discussed, but the emphasis is on how practical implementation proceeds. In addition, the author suggests future directions for adapting the LAPW method to simulations of complex materials requiring large unit cells. He does this by elucidating the connections between the LAPW method and planewave pseudopotential approaches and by showing how Car-Parrinello type algorithms can be adapted to the LAPW method. The new edition contains new sections on developments over the last 10 years, including for example the LDA+U method, non-collinear magnetism and the APW+LO method.},

abstract = {Chemistry is determined by the electrostatic forces acting within a collection of nuclei and electrons. The attraction of the nuclei for the electrons is the only attractive force in a molecule and is the force responsible for the bonding between atoms. This is the attractive force acting on the electrons in the Ehrenfest force and on the nuclei in the Feynman force, one that is countered by the repulsion between the electrons in the former and by the repulsion between the nuclei in the latter. The virial theorem relates these forces to the energy changes resulting from interactions between atoms. All bonding, as signified by the presence of a bond path, has a common origin in terms of the mechanics determined by the Ehrenfest, Feynman and virial theorems. This paper is concerned in particular with the mechanics of interaction encountered in what are classically described as 'nonbonded interactions' - are atoms that 'touch' bonded or repelling one another? {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry 2006.},

abstract = {We present an efficient scheme for calculating the Kohn-Sham ground state of metallic systems using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. In the first part the application of Pulay's DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order (Formula presented) operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay's scheme. A special “metric” and a special “preconditioning” optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order (Formula presented) scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach (Formula presented). We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Density Functional Theory (DFT) is one of the most widely used methods for "ab initio" calculations of the structure of atoms, molecules, crystals, surfaces, and their interactions. Unfortunately, the customary introduction to DFT is often considered too lengthy to be included in various curricula. An alternative introduction to DFT is presented here, drawing on ideas which are well-known from thermodynamics, especially the idea of switching between different independent variables. The central theme of DFT, i.e. the notion that it is possible and beneficial to replace the dependence on the external potential v(r) by a dependence on the density distribution n(r), is presented as a straightforward generalization of the familiar Legendre transform from the chemical potential ($\backslash$mu) to the number of particles (N). This approach is used here to introduce the Hohenberg-Kohn energy functional and to obtain the corresponding theorems, using classical nonuniform fluids as simple examples. The energy functional for electronic systems is considered next, and the Kohn-Sham equations are derived. The exchange-correlation part of this functional is discussed, including both the local density approximation to it, and its formally exact expression in terms of the exchange-correlation hole. A very brief survey of various applications and extensions is included.},

@phdthesis{Harl2008,
abstract = {The linear response function, which describes the change in the electron density induced by a change in the external potential, is the basis for a broad variety of applications. Three of these are addressed in the present thesis. In the first part, optical spectra of metallic surfaces are investigated. Quasiparticle energies, i.e., energies required to add or remove an electron from a system, are evaluated for selected metals in the second part. The final part of this thesis is devoted to an improved description of the ground-state electron correlation energy. In the first part, the linear response function is used to evaluate optical properties of metallic surfaces. In recent years, reflectance difference (RD) spectroscopy has provided a sensitive experimental method to detect changes in the surface structure and morphology. The interpretation of the resulting spectra, which are linked to the anisotropy of the surface dielectric tensor, however, is often difficult. In the present thesis, we simulate RD spectra for the bare, as well as oxygen and carbon monoxide covered, Cu(110) surface, and assign features in these spectra to the corresponding optical transitions. A good qualitative agreement between our RD spectra and the experimental data is found. Density functional theory (DFT) gives only access to the ground state energy. Quasiparticle energies should, however, be addressed within many body perturbation theory. In the second part of this thesis, we investigate quasiparticle energies for the transition metals Cu, Ag, Fe, and Ni using the Green's function based GW approximation, where the screened Coulomb interaction W is linked to the linear response function. The fundamental limitation of density function theory is the approximation of the exchange-correlation energy. An exact expression for the exchange-correlation energy can be found by the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem (ACFDT), linking the linear response function to the electron correlation energy. This expression has been implemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). Technical issues and ACFDT results obtained for molecules and extended systems, are addressed in the third and last part of this thesis. Although we make use of the random phase approximation (RPA), we find that the correct long-range van der Waals interaction for rare gas solids is reproduced and geometrical properties for insulators, semiconductors, and metals are in very good agreement with experiment. Atomization energies, however, are not significantly improved compared to standard DFT functionals like PBE.},

These methods are exact for systems of slowly varying or high density. For the ground state, they lead to self-consistent equations analogous to the Hartree and Hartree-Fock equations, respectively. In these equations the exchange and correlation portions of the chemical potential of a uniform electron gas appear as additional effective potentials.

Electronic systems at finite temperatures and in magnetic fields are also treated by similar methods.

@article{Kresse1993,
abstract = {We present ab initio quantum-mechanical molecular-dynamics calculations based on the calculation of the electronic ground state and of the Hellmann-Feynman forces in the local-density approximation at each molecular-dynamics step. This is possible using conjugate-gradient techniques for energy minimization, and predicting the wave functions for new ionic positions using sub-space alignment. This approach avoids the instabilities inherent in quantum-mechanical molecular-dynamics calculations for metals based on the use of a fictitious Newtonian dynamics for the electronic degrees of freedom. This method gives perfect control of the adiabaticity and allows us to perform simulations over several picoseconds. A few years ago Car and Parrinello introduced an approach that unifies molecular-dynamics techniques for the calculation of the atomic structure with the local-density approximation2 (LDA) for electronic structure calculations, with the complete set of quantum-mechanical many-body forces calculated using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. The basic idea is the introduction of a fictitious dynamics for the electronic degrees of freedom. Since the electronic wave functions of the LDA are meaningful only if the electrons are in their ground state for the instantaneous ionic configuration , an essential condition for the practicability of the Car-Parrinello method is that the transfer of energy between the atomic and electronic subsystems is small in order to prevent the electron states to drift away from the ground states. This transfer of energy is difBcult to control in metallic systems. In insulators, the width of the electronic band gap divided by the fictitious mass of the electronic degrees of freedom defines the separation in the characteristic frequencies of the atomic and electronic motions. In metals, this separation is absent and there are essentially two mechanisms that drive metallic systems into nonadiabaticity: a resonance between the atomic and electronic frequencies opening a channel for energy transfer and a level crossing between occupied and empty electron states. s The operational solution of these nonadiabaticity problems is (a) to perform periodic energy minimizations to bring the system "back to the Born-Oppenheimer surface" or (b) to attach the electronic subsystem to a Nose thermostat that prevents the heating up of the electron system. s Clearly the alternative is to perform the minimization of the Kohn-Sham functional for the electronic total energy at any time step of the molecular-dynamics simulation, so that the problem of the nonadiabaticity does not arise at all. An efficient way to perform the minimization process are conjugate-gradient methods. These techniques have now been developed to a point were it is possible to perform canonical molecular-dynamics simulations for liquid metals over periods of several picoseconds, with complete control over deviations from adiabaticity and good energy conservation. Applications for liquid metals ranging from Na to Ge demonstrate very good agreement with the measured atomic structure factors and electronic spectra. Our technique for performing a complete calculation of the LDA ground state after each molecular-dynamics step is based on the conjugate-gradient techniques developed by Payne and co-workers. s s and used in self-consistent electronic structure calculations by Bylander, Kleinman, and Lee. s io The method is a doubly iterative one: in the inner loop the wave functions for each k point in the Brillouin zone and each band are improved by a preconditioned conjugate-gradient method as described in Ref. 9 until the change in the energy eigenvalue is smaller than 10 s eV (or smaller than 30{\%} of the change in the first step). After running over all bands (includ-ing some empty bands), a subspace diagonalization is performed, the new Fermi energy is calculated using a Gaussian broadening of the energy levels, and the charge density is updated. The problems arising from using fractional occupation numbers and their consequences for ab initio molecular-dynamics simulations have been discussed by Weinert and Davenportii and by Wentzcov-itch, Martins, and Allen. i2 It has been shown that the variational quantity is not the internal energy but a generalized free energy. To prevent charge sloshing, the mixing scheme proposed by Kerkeris is used. This scheme has the advantage of damping the oscillations in the low-q components of the charge density. The electronic-energy minimization is terminated when the change in the energy per atom becomes smaller than 1.5 x 10 s eV. The atomic motion is described by Nosh dynamicsi4 generating a canonical ensemble at prefixed temperature. The equations of motion are integrated using a fourth-order predictor-corrector algorithmis' s which allows the use of time steps as large as 3 x 10 s with good energy conservation. After moving the atoms, the new wave functions are estimated by using the subspace alignment proposed by Arias, Payne, and Joannopoulos. The calculation has been performed for a nonlocal pseudopotential in Kleinman-Bylander factorization, using the real-space projection scheme of King-Smith, Payne, and Lin. 7 The first test was performed for a 54-atom ensemble 47 558},

In large molecules and solids, however, calculating the exact (Hartree-Fock) exchange is computationally expensive, especially for systems with metallic characteristics. In the present work, we develop a new hybrid density functional based on a screened Coulomb potential for the exchange interaction which circumvents this bottleneck. The results obtained for structural and thermodynamic properties of molecules are comparable in quality to the most widely used hybrid functionals. In addition, we present results of periodic boundary condition calculations for both semiconducting and metallic single wall carbon nanotubes. Using a screened Coulomb potential for Hartree-Fock exchange enables fast and accurate hybrid calculations, even of usually difficult metallic systems. The high accuracy of the new screened Coulomb potential hybrid, combined with its computational advantages, makes it widely applicable to large molecules and periodic systems.

@article{Methfessel1989,
abstract = {We present a sampling method for Brillouin-zone integration in metals which converges exponentially with the number of sampling points, without the loss of precision of normal broadening techniques. The scheme is based on smooth approximants to the $\delta$ and step functions which are constructed to give the exact result when integrating polynomials of a prescribed degree. In applications to the simple-cubic tight-binding band as well as to band structures of simple and transition metals, we demonstrate significant improvement over existing methods. The method promises general applicability in the fields of total-energy calculations and many-body physics.},

@book{Kohanoff2006,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} J. Kohanoff 2006.Electronic structure problems are studied in condensed matter physics and theoretical chemistry to provide important insights into the properties of matter. This 2006 graduate textbook describes the main theoretical approaches and computational techniques, from the simplest approximations to the most sophisticated methods. It starts with a detailed description of the various theoretical approaches to calculating the electronic structure of solids and molecules, including density-functional theory and chemical methods based on Hartree-Fock theory. The basic approximations are thoroughly discussed, and an in-depth overview of recent advances and alternative approaches in DFT is given. The second part discusses the different practical methods used to solve the electronic structure problem computationally, for both DFT and Hartree-Fock approaches. Adopting a unique and open approach, this textbook is aimed at graduate students in physics and chemistry, and is intended to improve communication between these communities. It also serves as a reference for researchers entering the field.},
