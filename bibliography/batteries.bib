  abstract  = {Reversible high-voltage redox chemistry is an essential component of many electrochemical technologies, from (electro)catalysts to lithium-ion batteries. Oxygen-anion redox has garnered intense interest for such applications, particularly lithium-ion batteries, as it offers substantial redox capacity at more than 4 V versus Li/Li + in a variety of oxide materials. However, oxidation of oxygen is almost universally correlated with irreversible local structural transformations, voltage hysteresis and voltage fade, which currently preclude its widespread use. By comprehensively studying the Li 2−x Ir 1−y Sn y O 3 model system, which exhibits tunable oxidation state and structural evolution with y upon cycling, we reveal that this structure–redox coupling arises from the local stabilization of short approximately 1.8 {\AA} metal–oxygen $\pi$ bonds and approximately 1.4 {\AA} O–O dimers during oxygen redox, which occurs in Li 2−x Ir 1−y Sn y O 3 through ligand-to-metal charge transfer. Crucially, formation of these oxidized oxygen species necessitates the decoordination of oxygen to a single covalent bonding partner through formation of vacancies at neighbouring cation sites, driving cation disorder. These insights establish a point-defect explanation for why anion redox often occurs alongside local structural disordering and voltage hysteresis during cycling. Our findings offer an explanation for the unique electrochemical properties of lithium-rich layered oxides, with implications generally for the design of materials employing oxygen redox chemistry.},

abstract = {The book focuses on the solid-state physics, chemistry and electrochemistry that are needed to grasp the technology of and research on high-power Lithium batteries. After an exposition of fundamentals of lithium batteries, it includes experimental techniques used to characterize electrode materials, and a comprehensive analysis of the structural, physical, and chemical properties necessary to insure quality control in production. The different properties specific to each component of the batteries are discussed in order to offer manufacturers the capability to choose which kind of battery should be used: which compromise between power and energy density and which compromise between energy and safety should be made, and for which cycling life. Although attention is primarily on electrode materials since they are paramount in terms of battery performance and cost, different electrolytes are also reviewed in the context of safety concerns and in relation to the solid-electrolyte interface. Separators are also reviewed in light of safety issues. The book is intended not only for scientists and graduate students working on batteries but also for engineers and technologists who want to acquire a sound grounding in the fundamentals of battery science arising from the interaction of electrochemistry, solid state materials science, surfaces and interfaces.},

One is topotactic extraction of Li from Li3MnO4 to form LiMnO4 and the second is topotactic insertion of Li into Li3MnO4 to form Li5MnO4. In the experiments, it is found that the redox behavior of Li3MnO4 is complicated by disproportionation of Mn5+ in solution to form Mn4+ and Mn7+ and by other irreversible processes; although an initial capacity of about 275 mAh g-1 in lithium cells was achieved. Strategies based on structural considerations to improve the electrochemical properties of MnO4n- complexes are given.},

  abstract  = {Recently Armstrong and Bruce1 reported a layered modification of lithium manganese oxide, LiMnO2, isostructural with LiCoO2. LiMnO2 obtained by ion exchange from $\alpha$-NaMnO2 synthesized in air is characterized by x-ray diffraction and by electrochemical insertion and extraction of lithium in a series of voltage ranges between 1.5 and 4.5 V relative to a lithium electrode. During cycling, voltage plateaus at 3.0 and 4.0 V vs. Li develop, indicating that the material is converted from its original layered structure to a spinel structure. This finding is confirmed by x-ray diffraction. Contrary to expectations based on thermodynamics, insertion of larger amounts of lithium leads to a more complete conversion. We suggest that a relatively high mobility of manganese leaves Li and Mn randomly distributed in the close-packed oxygen lattice after a deep discharge. This isotropic Mn distribution can relatively easily relax to the Mn distribution characteristic of spinels whereas the anisotropic distribution characteristic of layered structures is not reformed when excess lithium is extracted.},

Reversible oxygen redox in the solid state in particular has the potential to enable high energy density as it can deliver excess capacity beyond the theoretical transition-metal redox-capacity at a high voltage. Nevertheless, the structural and chemical origin of the process is not understood, preventing the rational design of better cathode materials. Here, we demonstrate how very specific local Li-excess environments around oxygen atoms necessarily lead to labile oxygen electrons that can be more easily extracted and participate in the practical capacity of cathodes. The identification of the local structural components that create oxygen redox sets a new direction for the design of high-energy-density cathode materials.},

  abstract  = {Most lithium-ion batteries still rely on intercalation-type graphite materials for anodes, so it is important to consider their role in full cells for applications in electric vehicles. Here, we systematically evaluate the chemical and physical properties of six commercially-available natural and synthetic graphites to establish which factors have the greatest impact on the cycling stability of full cells with nickel-rich LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) cathodes. Electrochemical data and post-mortem characterization explain the origin of capacity fade. The NMC811 cathode shows large irreversible capacity loss and impedance growth, accounting for much of full cell degradation. However, six graphite anodes demonstrate significant differences with respect to structural change, surface area, impedance growth, and SEI chemistry, which impact overall capacity retention. We found long cycle life correlated most strongly with stable graphite crystallite size. In addition, graphites with lower surface area generally had higher coulombic efficiencies during formation cycles, which led to more stable long-term cycling. The best graphite screened here enables a capacity retention around 90{\%} in full pouch cells over extensive long-term cycling compared to only 82{\%} for cells with the lowest performing graphite. The results show that optimal graphite selection improves cycling stability of high energy lithium-ion cells.},

Additionally, the formation of the peroxo OO bond is calculated via density functional theory, and the corresponding OO bond length of ≈1.3 {\AA} matches well with the in situ Raman results.

Classical positive electrodes for Li-ion technology operate mainly through an insertion-deinsertion redox process involving cationic species. However, this mechanism is insufficient to account for the high capacities exhibited by the new generation of Li-rich (Li(1+x)Ni(y)Co(z)Mn(1-x-y-z)O₂) layered oxides that present unusual Li reactivity. In an attempt to overcome both the inherent composition and the structural complexity of this class of oxides, we have designed structurally related Li₂Ru(1-y)Sn(y)O₃ materials that have a single redox cation and exhibit sustainable reversible capacities as high as 230 mA h g(-1). Moreover, they present good cycling behaviour with no signs of voltage decay and a small irreversible capacity. We also unambiguously show, on the basis of an arsenal of characterization techniques, that the reactivity of these high-capacity materials towards Li entails cumulative cationic (M(n+)→M((n+1)+)) and anionic (O(2-)→O₂(2-)) reversible redox processes, owing to the d-sp hybridization associated with a reductive coupling mechanism. Because Li₂MO₃ is a large family of compounds, this study opens the door to the exploration of a vast number of high-capacity materials.},

This review will aim to describe the chemical rationale which has led to this material evolution prior to focus on Li-rich NMC phases which are sources of excitement but challenges as well. The benefits of going back to fundamentals to rationalize and understand the new science at work with these Li-rich NMC phases will be stressed and illustrated by the discovery of a new reversible anionic redox process. Issues regarding voltage fade and limited rate capability which are plaguing their present utilization in commercial Li-ion cells will be addressed as well and solutions proposed.

  abstract      = {Intercalation compounds, used as electrodes in Li-ion batteries, are a fascinating class of materials that exhibit a wide variety of electronic, crystallographic, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties. With open structures that allow for the easy insertion and removal of Li ions, the properties of these materials strongly depend on the interplay of the host chemistry and crystal structure, the Li concentration, and electrode particle morphology. The large variations in Li concentration within electrodes during each charge and discharge cycle of a Li battery are often accompanied by phase transformations. These transformations include order-disorder transitions, two-phase reactions that require the passage of an interface through the electrode particles, and structural phase transitions, in which the host undergoes a crystallographic change. Although the chemistry of an electrode material determines the voltage range in which it is electrochemically active, the crystal structure of the compound often plays a crucial role in determining the shape of the voltage profile as a function of Li concentration.While the relationship between the voltage profile and crystal structure of transition metal oxide and sulfide intercalation compounds is well characterized, far less is known about the kinetic behavior of these materials. For example, because these processes are especially difficult to isolate experimentally, solid-state Li diffusion, phase transformation mechanisms, and interface reactions remain poorly understood. In this respect, first-principles statistical mechanical approaches can elucidate the effect of chemistry and crystal structure on kinetic properties.In this Account, we review the key factors that govern Li diffusion in intercalation compounds and illustrate how the complexity of Li diffusion mechanisms correlates with the crystal structure of the compound. A variety of important diffusion mechanisms and associated migration barriers are sensitive to the overall Li concentration, resulting in diffusion coefficients that can vary by several orders of magnitude with changes in the lithium content. Vacancy clusters, groupings of vacancies within the crystal lattice, provide a common mechanism that mediates Li diffusion in important intercalation compounds. This mechanism emerges from specific crystallographic features of the host and results in a strong decrease of the Li diffusion coefficient as Li is added to an already Li rich host. Other crystallographic and electronic factors, such as the proximity of transition metal ions to activated states of hops and the occurrence of electronically induced distortions, can result in a strong dependence of the Li mobility on the overall Li concentration. The insights obtained from fundamental studies of ionic diffusion in electrode materials will be instrumental for physical chemists, chemical engineers, synthetic chemists, and materials and device designers who are developing these technologies. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract = {Graphitic carbon is currently considered the state-of-the-art material for the negative electrode in lithium ion cells, mainly due to its high reversibility and low operating potential. However, carbon anodes exhibit mediocre charge/discharge rate performance, which contributes to severe transport-induced surface structural damage upon prolonged cycling and limits the lifetime of the cell. Lithium bulk diffusion in graphitic carbon is not yet completely understood, partly due to the complexity of measuring bulk transport properties in finite-sized nonisotropic particles. To solve this problem for graphite, we use the Devanathan-Stachurski electrochemical methodology combined with ab initio computations to deconvolute and quantify the mechanism of lithium ion diffusion in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The results reveal inherent high lithium ion diffusivity in the direction parallel to the graphene plane (∼10-7-10-6 cm2 s-1), as compared to sluggish lithium ion transport along grain boundaries (∼10 -11 cm2 s-1), indicating the possibility of rational design of carbonaceous materials and composite electrodes with very high rate capability. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract  = {Li-rich layered oxides have been intensively investigated as cathodes for high energy lithium-ion batteries. However, oxygen loss from the lattice during the initial charge and gradual structural transformation during cycling can lead to capacity degradation and potential decay of the cathode materials. In this work, Sn4+ is used to partially substitute Mn4+ to prepare a series of Li(Li0.17Ni0.25Mn0.58-xSnx)O2 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.03, and 0.05) samples through a spray-drying method. Structural characterization reveals that the Sn4+ substituted samples with a suitable amount show low cation mixing, indicating an enhanced ordered layer structure. Moreover, the metal-oxygen (M-O) covalency is gradually decreased with increasing Sn4+ amount. It is shown from the initial charge-discharge curves that Sn4+ substituted samples present a shorter charging potential plateau at 4.5 V (vs. Li/Li+), implying that oxidation of the O2- ion to O2 is suppressed by Sn4+ substitution and leads to a minor structural change. Among the Sn4+ substituted samples, the Li(Li0.17Ni0.25Mn0.55Sn0.03)O2 sample exhibits a higher capacity retention of 86{\%} after 400 cycles at 0.1C rate and 92{\%} after 200 cycles at 1C rate, showing excellent cycle stability and high-rate capability as compared with the as-prepared sample. The electrochemical performance improvement can be attributed to the influences of Sn such as enlarging the Li ion diffusion channel due to the large ionic radius of Sn4+ substitution with respect to Mn4+, a higher bonding energy of Sn-O than Mn-O, and weakening the M-O covalency. All the influences are favorable for stabilization of the host lattice in Li-rich layered oxides.},

Here, we demonstrate directly, by in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), that O2 is evolved from such Mn4+-containing compounds, Li[Ni0.2Li0.2Mn0.6]O2, on charging and using powder neutron diffraction show that O loss from the surface is accompanied by diffusion of transition metal ions from surface to bulk where they occupy vacancies created by Li removal. The composition of the compound moves toward MO2.

  abstract = {The energy density delivered by a Li-ion battery is a key parameter that needs to be significantly increased to address the global question of energy storage for the next 40 years. This quantity is directly proportional to the battery voltage (V) and the battery capacity (C) which are difficult to improve simultaneously when materials exhibit classical cationic redox activity. Recently, a cumulative cationic (M4+/M5+) and anionic (2O2-/(O2)n-) redox activity has been demonstrated in the Li-rich Li2MO3 family of compounds, therefore enabling doubling of the energy density with respect to high-potential cathodes such as transition metal phosphates and sulfates. This paper aims to clarify the origin of this extra capacity by addressing some fundamental questions regarding reversible anionic redox in high-potential electrodes for Li-ion batteries. First, the ability of the system to stabilize the oxygen holes generated by Li-removal and to achieve a reversible oxo- to peroxo-like (2O2-/(O2)n-) transformation is elucidated by means of a metal-driven reductive coupling mechanism. The penchant of the system for undergoing this reversible anionic redox or releasing O2 gas is then discussed with regards to experimental results for 3d- and 4d-based Li2MO3 phases. Finally, robust indicators are built as tools to predict which materials in the Li-rich TM-oxide family will undergo efficient and reversible anionic redox. The present finding provides insights into new directions to be explored for the development of high-energy density materials for Li-ion batteries.},

To elucidate the origin of this phenomenon, we employ chemical substitution in structurally related Li2RuO3 compounds. Li-rich layered Li2Ru1-yTiyO3 phases with capacities of {\~{}}240 mAh g(-1) exhibit the characteristic voltage decay on cycling. A combination of transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies reveals that the migration of cations between metal layers and Li layers is an intrinsic feature of the charge-discharge process that increases the trapping of metal ions in interstitial tetrahedral sites. A correlation between these trapped ions and the voltage decay is established by expanding the study to both Li2Ru1-ySnyO3 and Li2RuO3; the slowest decay occurs for the cations with the largest ionic radii. This effect is robust, and the finding provides insights into new chemistry to be explored for developing high-capacity layered electrodes that evade voltage decay.},

  abstract = {Lithium-rich oxide electrodes with layered structures have attracted considerable interest because they can deliver high energy densities for lithium-ion batteries. However, there is significant debate regarding their redox chemistry. It is apparent that the mechanism of lithium extraction from lithium-rich Li2MnO3 is not fully understood, especially in relation to the observed O2 evolution and structural transformation. Here, delithiation and kinetic processes in Li2MnO3 are investigated using ab initio simulation techniques employing high level hybrid functionals as they reproduce accurately the electronic structure of oxygen hole states. We show that Li extraction is charge-compensated by oxidation of the oxide anion, so that the overall delithiation reaction involves lattice oxygen loss. Localized holes on oxygen (O-) are formed as the first step but are not stable leading to oxygen dimerization (with O-O ∼ 1.3 {\AA}) and eventually to the formation of molecular O2. Oxygen dimerization facilitates Mn migration onto octahedral sites in the vacated lithium layers. The results suggest that reversible oxygen redox without major structural changes is only possible if the localized oxygen holes are stabilized and oxygen dimerization suppressed. Such an understanding is important for the future optimization of new lithium-rich cathode materials for high energy density batteries.},

These findings indicate that the introduction of O-vacancy activates the Mn sites as the redox center in the lithium extraction process.

This results in a high O-vacancy density in the crystal, which in turn triggers a drastic volume reduction during the lithium extraction process. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Electrochemical Society.},

  abstract  = {Transition-metal (TM) oxides play an increasingly important role in technology today, including applications such as catalysis, solar energy harvesting, and energy storage. In many of these applications, the details of their electronic structure near the Fermi level are critically important for their properties. We propose a first-principles-based computational methodology for the accurate prediction of oxygen charge transfer in TM oxides and lithium TM (Li-TM) oxides. To obtain accurate electronic structures, the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional is adopted, and the amount of exact Hartree-Fock exchange (mixing parameter) is adjusted to reproduce reference band gaps. We show that the HSE06 functional with optimal mixing parameter yields not only improved electronic densities of states, but also better energetics (Li-intercalation voltages) for LiCoO2 and LiNiO2 as compared to the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), Hubbard U corrected GGA (GGA+U), and standard HSE06. We find that the optimal mixing parameters for TM oxides are system specific and correlate with the covalency (ionicity) of the TM species. The strong covalent (ionic) nature of TM-O bonding leads to lower (higher) optimal mixing parameters. We find that optimized HSE06 functionals predict stronger hybridization of the Co3d and O2p orbitals as compared to GGA, resulting in a greater contribution from oxygen states to charge compensation upon delithiation in LiCoO2. We also find that the band gaps of Li-TM oxides increase linearly with the mixing parameter, enabling the straightforward determination of optimal mixing parameters based on GGA ($\alpha$=0.0) and HSE06 ($\alpha$=0.25) calculations. Our results also show that G0W0@GGA+U band gaps of TM oxides (MO,M=Mn,Co,Ni) and LiCoO2 agree well with experimental references, suggesting that G0W0 calculations can be used as a reference for the calibration of the mixing parameter in cases when no experimental band gap has been reported.},

  abstract  = {Ever-growing energy needs and depleting fossil-fuel resources demand the pursuit of sustainable energy alternatives, including both renewable energy sources and sustainable storage technologies. It is therefore essential to incorporate material abundance, eco-efficient synthetic processes and life-cycle analysis into the design of new electrochemical storage systems. At present, a few existing technologies address these issues, but in each case, fundamental and technological hurdles remain to be overcome. Here we provide an overview of the current state of energy storage from a sustainability perspective. We introduce the notion of sustainability through discussion of the energy and environmental costs of state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries, considering elemental abundance, toxicity, synthetic methods and scalability. With the same themes in mind, we also highlight current and future electrochemical storage systems beyond lithium-ion batteries. The complexity and importance of recycling battery materials is also discussed.},

  abstract      = {Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries that rely on cationic redox reactions are the primary energy source for portable electronics. One pathway toward greater energy density is through the use of Li-rich layered oxides. The capacity of this class of materials ({\textgreater}270 milliampere hours per gram) has been shown to be nested in anionic redox reactions, which are thought to form peroxo-like species. However, the oxygen-oxygen (O-O) bonding pattern has not been observed in previous studies, nor has there been a satisfactory explanation for the irreversible changes that occur during first delithiation. By using Li2IrO3 as a model compound, we visualize the O-O dimers via transmission electron microscopy and neutron diffraction. Our findings establish the fundamental relation between the anionic redox process and the evolution of the O-O bonding in layered oxides.},
