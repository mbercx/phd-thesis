abstract = {A means of correcting total energy pseudopotential calculations performed using a fixed cut-off energy for the plane waves in the basis set is presented. The use of a finite set of special k-points in such a calculation will introduce errors in the total energies which decrease only slowly with increasing cut-off energy. In particular, total energy differences are not accurate unless the cut-off energy used is sufficiently large that the total energies are themselves converged. This would not be the case if a truly constant cut-off energy could be used. Unfortunately this can only be achieved by using an infinite k-point set. The authors have derived a correction which will explicitly eliminate these errors to give total energies which can correspond to a strictly constant cut-off energy. In this way, total energy differences and hence many physical properties can be accurately calculated using cut-off energies significantly lower than otherwise possible, with substantial savings in computational time.},

@techreport{Tasker1979,
abstract = {When there is a dipole moment in the repeat unit perpendicular to the sur ace in an ionic crystal, lattice sums in the electrostatic energy diverge and the calculated surface energy is infinite. The cause of this divergence is demonstrated and the surfaces of any ionic or partly ionic material are classified into three types. Type 1 is neutral with equal numbers of anions and cations on each plane and type 2 is charged but there is no dipole moment perpendicular to the surface because of the symmetrical stacking sequence. Both these surfaces should have modest surface energies and may be stable with only limited relaxations of the ions in the surface region. The type 3 surface is charged and has a dipole moment in the repeat unit perpendicular to the surface. This surface can only be stabilised by substantial reconstruction. These conclusions are important for the analysis of the surface structure of ionic crystals.},

abstract = {We present the Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) library, a robust, open-source Python library for materials analysis. A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project's REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen's interface to the Materials Project's RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li 4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li-Sn-S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper introduces FireWorks, a workflow software for running high-throughput calculation workflows at supercomputing centers. FireWorks has been used to complete over 50 million CPU-hours worth of computational chemistry and materials science calculations at the National Energy Research Supercomputing Center. It has been designed to serve the demanding high-throughput computing needs of these applications, with extensive support for (i) concurrent execution through job packing, (ii) failure detection and correction, (iii) provenance and reporting for long-running projects, (iv) automated duplicate detection, and (v) dynamic workflows (i.e., modifying the workflow graph during runtime). We have found that these features are highly relevant to enabling modern data-driven and high-throughput science applications, and we discuss our implementation strategy that rests on Python and NoSQL databases (MongoDB). Finally, we present performance data and limitations of our approach along with planned future work.},

abstract = {The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple 'for-loop' construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.},

We demonstrate that a large number of band gaps and effective masses are available. We also discuss convergence of the method with respect to unit cell size and the combined optimization of band gap and effective mass for AlGaAs and GaInP semiconductor alloys. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},
