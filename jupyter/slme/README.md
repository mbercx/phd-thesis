# Solar Cells

## CuAu-likes

For the calculation of the optical properties of the CuAu-like (#115) and 
chalcopyrite (#122) structures, we start from the provided template files of the 
AlCuS$_2$ compound.

> _Note that the calculations performed via these notebooks do not currently match 
with the results presented in the thesis. As solar cells was the first topic I 
worked on, the results presented in the thesis were obtained before I started 
using workflows and Jupyter notebooks. However, the results should be largely 
reproducible based on these notebooks, save for the G0W0 calculations. These 
may still be added in the future._
