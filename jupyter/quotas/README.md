# Ion-induced Secondary Electron Emission

## Semiconductors

> Note: the calculations for the (111) surfaces of Ge and Si were initially performed manually, so I'm still in the process of setting up the notebooks for reproducing these results.

## Metals

All of the structures were taken from the supplementary materials of [De Waele et al](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.235418). Based on these structures, workflows were set up as shown in the [workflows notebook](metals/workflows.ipynb). Using the code in the [process data notebook](process_data.ipynb), the VASP output was gathered into several dictionaries for the different analyses presented below.

### Plasmons

Based on the workflow output for several surfaces, we have fit the plasmon parameters of our model by comparing the calculated yield spectra to the experimental results in the literature. This is done in the [plasmon parameters notebook](metals/plasmon_parameters.ipynb). The final figures in the thesis were generated using the first part of the [figures notebook](metals/figures.ipynb).

### Comparison with experiment

All of the figures comparing the experimental results to the calculated ones, as well as the projected DOS, were set up in the [figures notebook](metals/figures.ipynb). The table of the work functions and total yields were generated by the [tables notebook](metals/tables.ipynb).

### High-throughput results

The data for the high-throughput analysis is processed and used to plot the figure in the thesis in the [high throughput notebook](metals/high_throughput.ipynb).
