# Ion-induced Secondary Electron Emission

## Semiconductors

> Note: the calculations for the (111) surfaces of Ge and Si were initially performed manually, so I'm still in the process of setting up the notebooks for reproducing these results.

## Metals

All of the structures were taken from the supplementary materials of [De Waele et al](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.235418). Based on these structures, workflows were set up as shown in the [workflows notebook](metals/workflows.ipynb). Using the code in the [process data notebook](process_data.ipynb), the VASP output was gathered into several dictionaries for the different analyses presented below.

### High-throughput results

The data for the high-throughput analysis is processed and used to plot the figure in the thesis in the [high throughput notebook](metals/high_throughput.ipynb).
