# Batteries

> Note that as the workflows do not currently support non-collinear calculations, the results for Li$_2$IrO$_3$ were obtained the old-fashioned way.

## Li-rich battery cathodes

Here I will describe the calculations for the oxygen framework stability analysis and provide links to the corresponding notebooks.

### Structure and Li configuration

The workflows for the calculation of the Li configuration are set up and sent to the mongoDB server in the [workflows notebook](li_configuration/workflows.ipynb). Once complete, the output of the calculations was processed into the `.json` files in the `data` directory using the [process data notebook](li_configuration/process_data.ipynb).
The final analysis is performed in the [analysis notebook](li_configuration/analysis.ipynb).
